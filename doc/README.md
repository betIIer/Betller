Betller coin Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
[Betller Core](http://betller.io) is the original Betller client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Betller transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Betller Core on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/betller-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/betllerd` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run betller-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag Betller-Qt to your applications folder, and then run Betller-Qt.
